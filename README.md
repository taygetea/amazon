### preliminary exploratory analysis of Amazon.com review data using word2vec

We are relying on [datasets provided by Julian McAuley](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/).

Given Python 3 and Pip, install the dependencies (may require root privileges for a global installation) with:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

(Some of the dependencies may also be available through your distribution's package manager; for example, while preparing this README, the present author used the `python3-scipy` package from the Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 LTS repositories.)
